## Pre-Lab Files
This folder contains a matlab initilization file that sets all the important initila parameters and control matrices. It also contains two theorectical models for fixed point and trajectory control

## Control Files
This folder also contains an init file but the simulink files are the applied control of the system using the NI anolog I/O

## Old Models
